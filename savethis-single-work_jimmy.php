                    <p>Filmmaker, climber, skier, father. Jimmy wears many hats. Even so, he never wavers on his commitment to bringing his complete passion to all of these areas. Although most of us can relate in a way, Jimmy’s experience with the most challenging terrain in the world, brings it to a whole new level.</p>
                    <p>This begs the question, how do you cross accounting and advisory services with mountain climbing? Simple answer, really. Relationships. We’ve worked with Baker Tilly since 2014 and throughout the years, we’ve become their trusted story partner, taking complex, unrelated ideas and molding them into a relatable, character-driven narrative.</p>

                    <p>Talking with Jimmy, we expected to hear the harrowing tales of near deaths, flash blizzards, and frost bite but what we got was so much more than that. We learned that deep down, right at the center of his being, he’s driven by one thing above all, he wants to contribute something meaningful to the world. Words that are easy to say, but much more difficult to live. When we parted ways, we knew we’d made a friend for life, and learned more than a little something along the way.</p>
